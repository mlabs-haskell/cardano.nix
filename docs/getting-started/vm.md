This project provides a virtual machine configuration with all cardano services.

`nix run github:mlabs-haskell/cardano.nix#vm-preview`

A virtual machine will be started with the following services, and the following ports forwarded from the host to the VM.

| Service      | Port                                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| cardano-node | 3001                                           |
| ogmios       | [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) |
| kupo         | [http://localhost:1442](http://localhost:1442) |

You can log in with user `root`. The password is empty. In the virtual machine, `cardano-cli` is available to query the node.

`cardano-cli query tip --testnet-magic 2`
